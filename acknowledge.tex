I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to Prof. Song Tang for his expert guidance and constructive
feedback throughout the course of this project. I appreciate the patience with which he would tackle my
doubts and the time he would spare from his busy schedule to meet during the course of his work-day
to discuss. His inputs to this project are invaluable. I would also like to thank the Finance and Risk
Engineering department at NYU Tandon School of Engineering to give me the opportunity to work on this advanced topic for my
capstone project, during the course of which I learned a lot.
